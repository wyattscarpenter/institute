# The Carpenter Institute For The Perfection Of Arts And Science, The Immanentization Of Truth And Justice, And The Relief Of Man's Estate

## General activity

The Carpenter Institute (ci) is a research institution focused on the aim detailed above. The primary activity of ci is the appointment of fellows, who then deliver infrequent reports to ci on their areas of research, in the form of articles, memoranda, and other academic publications. Collectively, these publications form _The Proceedings Of The Carpenter Institute_ (pci). Pci publications are detailed in the Timeline section, below. Pci is a peer-reviewed journal. Peer-reviewed journals often fall into either sins of laxity, in which all manner of pseudoscience can be published without challenge, or stringency, in which nothing opposed to the dogmas of the field may be published; ci attempts to balance these concerns by erring on the side of laxity but providing reviewer critique alongside. Ci is also a degree-granting institution of higher learning. Ci is also an accreditation body.

The Carpenter Institute does not generally provide services or information related to carpentry. Nor should it be confused with the Carpenter Foundation of Rogue Valley, nor the E. Rhodes and Leona B. Carpenter Foundation.

## Degrees grantable

Ci reserves the right to, in the future, award high-school-equivalent degrees upon evaluating that an applicant has achieved a sufficient level of understanding of various subjects befitting the ken of a gentleman citizen. A particular focus on one subject may be added, although this is unusual. However, ci currently does not award these degrees as the evaluation process would be too involved.

Ci may award associates' degrees in various subjects upon evaluating that an applicant has achieved a sufficient level of understanding of that subject.

Ci reserves the right to, in the future, award bachelors' degrees upon evaluating that an applicant has achieved a sufficient level of understanding of various subjects befitting the ken of a gentleman scholar. A particular focus on one subject may be added. However, ci currently does not award these degrees as the evaluation process would be too involved.

Ci may award masters' degrees in various subjects upon evaluating that an applicant has achieved a sufficient level of understanding of that subject. A thesis or project may accompany this.

Ci may award doctorates (such as a PhD) in various subjects upon evaluating that an applicant has achieved a sufficient level of understanding of that subject, and also that the applicant has submitted a thesis that presents a novel contribution to the field, and also that the applicant has passed a suitable thesis defense thereof.

In general, ci degrees are more difficult than the analogous degrees at other institutions, because they actually require what they claim to require. However, they are also easy in that they do not require anything they do not claim to require. For instance, ci does not typically offer classes or have a fixed academic schedule, so an associate's degree could theoretically be earned by a motivated individual in a month by reading 10 books.
